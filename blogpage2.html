                        <h2>Somali Poetry and its Potency</h2>
                    <p class="blog">Sayyid Mahammad Abdille Hasan (April 7, 1856-December 21, 1920), leader of Somalia’s national liberation movement in the early decades of the 20th century, is widely regarded as one of Somalia’s most prolific poet. Sayyid Mahammad Abdille Hasan was deeply religious and rooted in pastoral tradition. Gifted in the art of political rhetoric, the Somali nationalist utilized his oratorical power as a weapon in a sustained campaign against colonialists and their collaborators. The British invaders called him “Mad Mullah” for his unrelenting fighting spirit and the tenacity with which his movement resisted foreign occupation. In his book; Oral Poetry and Somali Nationalism, renowned Somali Scholar and Writer, Said Sheikh Samatar asserts that, Mahammad Abdille Hasan’s  ability to merge thoughts and feelings into formidable verbal expressions, remain proverbial among Somalis. According to Said Samatar, it is the connection between politics and oral poetry in Somali pastoral tradition that helped Sayyid to use his verbal prowess for political expediency, to degrade enemies and to boost his power and position in the land. </p>

                    <p>Somalia is a “Nation of Poets” and a European visiting the country in the 19th century once found it strange that an unwritten language was so abound with poetry and eloquence. At the time, Somali language was not in written form. The National Orthography for Somali in Latin script was introduced in 1972. Somalis through the ages enjoyed a rich oral culture that featured poetry as its highest form of art. Further explaining the place of oral poetry in Somali pastoral tradition, the distinguished Somali Scholar, Samatar, says in his book, “Poetry is not the craft of an esoteric group of beauty minded men whose role in society is at best marginal. On the contrary, his craft places the Somali poet in the mainstream of society and his energies and imagination are constantly drawn upon for social purposes, his kinsmen expect a Somali poet to defend their rights in clan disputes, to defend their honours and  prestige against the attacks of rival poets, to immortalize their fame and to act on the whole as a spokesman for them.” </p>
                    <p>In an essay titled: “The Mirror of Culture: Somali Dissolution Seen Through Oral Expression” eminent Somali Novelist and playwright, Maxamed Daahir Afrax concurs on the importance of oral poetry in pastoral tradition, he writes, “The abundance of Somali oral expression and the exceptionally important role it plays in Somali life has repeatedly been confirmed by early testimonials of outside observers and scholarly works by contemporary researchers of different origins.” Maxamed Afrax feels that Somalis pastoral traditions can be effective for tribal reconciliation, more so in this post-conflict period. According to Maxamed, “Somali oral tradition teems with hundreds of proverbs, poems, and prose narratives with explicit messages condemning violence and despotism. They preach the value of peace and the value of law and order.” </p>

                    <p>At the time Sayyid Mahammad Abdille Hasan was leading a war against colonialists, another Somali poet Elmi Bodari or Ilmi Bodheri born 1908, was coming of age. His full name was Ilmi Ismail Liban and the nickname, Bodari/Bodheri, is a Somali mispronunciation of the English word border, as he hailed from a place that bordered Ethiopia. Elmi’s story is a tragedy. As the story goes, Elmi Bodari was love-struck by a girl named Hodhan and he begun composing explicit poetry declaring his love for her. This was unheard off at the time, poetry was revered as an oral expression of pastoral traditions and love was never a subject. Moreover, Elmi’s infatuation with Hodhan would never lead to marriage, as Hodhan’s family had already bestowed her to someone else. Elmi’s love poems were written in the 1930s and early 1940s and these odes remain legendary among Somalis. Unfortunately, Elmi remained heart broken and it is often said that he was the first Somali man to die from love. He was only 32 years old. </p>
